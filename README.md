## Overview
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on tweets using Naive Bayes classifier implemented from scratch. It offers a practical approach to understanding how sentiment analysis can be applied to social media data, specifically focusing on analyzing the sentiment of tweets.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: In-depth preprocessing of tweet data including cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual analysis of data distribution and characteristics.
Naive Bayes from Scratch: Custom implementation of Naive Bayes for binary classification of tweet sentiments.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance using standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1).

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset comprising tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels, focusing on the binary classification of sentiments.

## Libraries Used
Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
## Objective
The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of Naive Bayes in sentiment analysis and provide a foundational understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
